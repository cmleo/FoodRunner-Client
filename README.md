# FoodRunner-Client

In this repository you will find the Client side for my Cross-Platform Food Delivery Mobile App. 

The app is built with React Native, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB . 

This application represented the final project for my bachelor's degree . 

You can find the repository for the API of this project on the link below

## Available Scripts

To start the App:

In the project directory, you must run:

## 1 

### `npm install` or `npm i`

Installs all dependencies 

## 2

### `npx expo start`

This command starts a server on http://localhost:19000 that a client can use to interact with the bundler. The default bundler is Metro.

To view and interact with the App you need to :

## 1 
## Install on your device (either iOS/Android) the following app:

- From you Google Play Store, if you have an Android device: Expo

- From your App Store, if you have an iOS device: Expo Go

## 2
## On that app you need to tap on "Scan QR code" and then scan the QR code from your terminal that is displayed when `npx expo start` is used .
